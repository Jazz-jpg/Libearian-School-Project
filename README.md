# *Libearian*

*Oakland University - CSI 2999 - Senior Capstone - Summer 2019*

A Librarian style web app for ordering and returning books to a local library



## Problem Statement

In todays modern Era there is a constant push towards technology and with technology we are getting a lot of new ways to take advantage of E-commerce. This application looks to take the traditional E-commerce spin and port it to a fictional phone-application that a local library system might use. to keep track of their users as well as the books that are being checked out.

## Objectives

* Allow Admin users (Librarians) To monitor the status of books
* Allow Admin Users to place orders for additional books
* Allow Admin Users to directly edit regular user profiles.
* Allow regular users to check out books that the admin user had ordered for the system.
* Allow all users a wide selection of books from Googles Book API
* Allow users to log-in using proprietary created login system
* Allow users to edit their profiles
* Create a mobile platform where UX is a focus.

## Who We Are

We are a group of students at Oakland University majoring in Computer Science, And Information Technology This phone application is for a Sophomore Capstone course project that we are all collaborating on. We wanted to make a Phone-Application that would have a practical applications in the real world, so we came up with The *Libearian* as a topic

## What *Libearian* Is

*Libearian* is a unique bookkeeping application that acts similar in function to an E-commerce site. Instead it is used to manage a library and it's books.

## How We Did It

We accomplished this mobile app through the use of Googles Book API and Flutter. In addition to firebase as our form of data storage. This was our first project where we had garnered any hands-on practical experience and we chose to do a lot of things unassisted.

* The Login system is proprietary, basic and rudementary. It is not something that we sourced from anywhere. Nor is it a very complex authentication system.
* We implemented Googles book API to load in books for our users.
* We designed a good user experience from scratch to allow easy interactions with our Application
* Firebase database storage was used to store users, permissions, and books that were ordered from the API.

## Why We Did It

This project was a class requirement of ours, and our first introduction to group work. We used it as a way to garner real group experience in an AGILE Scrum environment. And get any bad practices out of our system. It also allowed us to take a deep dive into real software engineering design skills. Such as diagrams and pre-planning.

## What Technologies We Used

* Flutter
* Dart
* Firebase Real Time Database
* Google Books API
