## synopsis

This is our first attempt at a school project, we had 8 weeks to start and complete it, and we had all decided to use a new framework and language we had never heard of before. in 6 weeks we were able to learn and accomplish as much as we have shown here through hard work and dedication to learning Flutter, Dart, and Firebase. Currently this is where our stopping point is.
